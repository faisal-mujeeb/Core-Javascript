/*
JavaScript is Synchronous in nature which means that it has an event loop that allows you to queue up an action that wonâ€™t take place until the loop is available sometime after the code that queued the action has finished executing.
 But there are a lot of functionalities in our program that make our code Asynchronous and one of them is the Async/Await functionality.

Async/Await is the extension of promises that we get as support in the language.
